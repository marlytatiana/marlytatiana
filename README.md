### Hey there 👋


I'm Marly Tatiana Celis Galvez, originally from Colombia and a PhD candidate at Utrecht School of Economics in The Netherlands https://www.uu.nl/staff/MTCelisGalvez

My Phd research focuses on effective public procurment. My research has a microeconomic approach as I'm interested in studying the market and regulatory incentives that shape public officers' behaviour and the behaviour of the suppliers of the procurement market.

I'm a member of the Utrecht University Centre for Public Procurement (UUcePP) https://www.uu.nl/en/background/interview-marly-tatiana-celis-galvez

Before coming to Utrecht, I worked at Colombia’s National Planning Department, Regional Research Center CRECE, and worked as a consultant/researcher. I hold an M.A. in Economics from Manizales University (Colombia). My previous work can be checked here https://sites.google.com/view/marly-tatiana-celis-galvez/home
