### Hey there 👋


- I'm Marly Tatiana Celis Galvez, originally from Colombia and a PhD candidate at Utrecht School of Economics in The Netherlands.

My Phd research focusses on effective public procurment. My research has a microeconomic approach as I'm interested in studying the market and regulatory incentives that shape public officers' behaviour and the behaviour of the suppliers of the procurement maket.
